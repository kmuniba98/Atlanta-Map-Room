# The Atlanta Map Room

To document and reflect upon the connections and disjunctions between civic data and lived experience in the city, through the collaborative creation of large-scale, interpretive maps.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* node.js

* ubuntu vm

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

After cloning the repository, ensure that node and npm are installed on your machine. Change directory into the main folder and run command `npm install` to install dependencies.

### Starting the Server

Navigate to the main directory and then move down one level to the /src folder. Run `node main.js` to start the server, which will listen on the port specified within the files (by default, port 8080).

Once the server is running, you should be able to navigate to the page in a web browser in order to view the index.html page, which shows links to the Controller, Projector, and Table pages.

The Controller page and Table page should be opened as two separate tabs on the iPad (or on a designated controller computer). The Projector page should be opened on a web browser on the projector computer.
