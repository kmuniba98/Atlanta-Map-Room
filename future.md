# Future Plans

## Projector Panel

The projector panel information should reflect the choices of the user. Ideally, the user could select a point on the table, and then select the fields they want to view for that point, then have the appropriate fields show up on the panel.

## Config File
Ideally all server settings, Mapbox API information, layers, and map styles should be pulled out of the javascript code and placed into a simple config file that can be accessed by all components of the application. This would reduce errors caused by differing map styles and layer names across different components of the web application.
